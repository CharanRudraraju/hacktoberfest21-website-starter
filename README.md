## Build a website that uses the Halloween Costume Contest API!

You have chosen to build a website! You can use any tech stack you want, as long as you deploy it 

### Requirements

Your website should fulfill AT LEAST these 5 user stories: 

```
- As a user, I can view all the contestantâ€™s costume images in some kind of list
- As a user, I can view all details about a single contestant
- As a user, I can upvote individual contestants 
- As a user, I can add a contestant
- As an user on a secret page, I can delete contestants
```

You can of course add other features, such as a secret page for updating contestant details, or a map displaying where each contestant is from, etc.
