## Build a website that uses the Halloween Costume Contest API!

You have chosen to build a website! You can use any tech stack you want, as long as you deploy it 

### Requirements

You can use ANY tech stack you like to build your website, as long as you deploy it.

Your website should fulfill AT LEAST these 5 user stories that consume the Halloween Costume Contest API: 

```
- As a user, I can view all contestants' costume images in some kind of list
- As a user, I can view all details about a single contestant
- As a user, I can upvote individual contestants 
- As a user, I can add a contestant
- As an user on a secret page, I can delete contestants
```

You can of course add other features, such as a secret page for updating contestant details, or a map displaying where each contestant is from, etc.

The design is all up to you! Be creative and have fun ðŸŽ¨ðŸ˜Ž

### How to use the API 

First, in Postman, fork [this mock server](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Hacktoberfest'21-~1ae1036b-6583-4883-949e-adf8b55687a1/collection/15567703-f6609889-8071-4251-9f1c-e55c7c6c45a3?ctx=documentation) we have prepared. It will allow you to make real API requests to get realistic fake data. 

> In Postman, a [Mock Server](https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/) is a real server that sends faked data. It allows frontend teams to write code that calls an API and gets realistic responses, without having to wait for the backend team to actually build the API! This is the API-First Way ðŸ˜Ž
